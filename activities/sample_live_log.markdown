Annie does not have her git configured, so we are helping her out with getting this done first.

Starting part 1.

All done with part 1. Nobody had any issues installing this first extension.





12:04
Starting part 2.

Running into problems. Annie and Mark seem to be done, but Joanna's setup does not work. We are all looking into it now. (edited)

Solved it! It turns out that Windows hides extensions and Notepad adds default .txt extensions to some files. Got it all sorted out and now the beastify extension is working fine.
12:15
Starting part 3
12:19
Mark is creating the file in which we are going to answer the questions.

Done with part 3. Starting part 4. (edited)

We all have our own favorite extensions, but after some discussion we decided to go with DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials.
12:30
Annie is wring the answers to questions as we explore the pages for that extension.

Almost done. We had trouble finding the repository. It does not seem that the DuckDuckGo website has a link to the repo with the actual code. We ended up using a Google DuckDuckGo search to find the repo.

For part 5, we decided that Annie should take a lead on creating and populating the repository since she has the least experience with GitHub.
12:50
We are still brainstorming ideas for the actual extension. We think we will put an MIT licenses on it.

Seems that nobody has access to the repository besides Annie. Need to figure out how to add Mark and Joanna as collaborators.

Wrapping up. Our proposal for the extension is fleshed out, but we may need to scaled it down for the actual implementation - we may not have enough experience to implement the whole thing.
