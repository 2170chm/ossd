Due by the end of this week (4/7):
- read the _Cathedral and the Bazaar_ (the second essay from the book, not the entire book)
- read chapter 1 in _Producing Open Source Software_
- read _Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software_
- blog about your thoughts based on the above readings:
	- explain (in your own words) the difference between software development following
	the cathedral model and software development following the bazaar model; which
	of the two environments do you personally prefer
	- _The Cathedral and The Bazaar_ essay has 19 “lessons”. Pick two of these that you find
	to be the most intriguing, interesting, telling, or ones that you simply liked.
	Quote them in your blog and try to explain what they’re supposed to mean.  
	- comment on the discussion of _free_ vs. _open_, in what way are the similar and how
	are they different?
- blog about  your personal progress towards the team project: what have you done,
what did you learn, what are the tasks that you will be working on next week
- update the contributions page on your blog (do not include your team contributions there, but
make sure that all of your own contributions are there)
