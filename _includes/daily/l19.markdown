__Group stand-up reports__ (~5 minutes each)
- which project you are working on?
- what is the project (assume other people never heard of it)?
- why did you pick this project?
- describe your interactions with the community so far
- describe the progress you made so far
(You can share the screen, if you wish to show your materials, but you do not have to.
You should, if possible, have you camera on so we can see the people who are talking.
Make sure that the talking is distributed between group members and that it is organized - you should
not be interrupting one another.)
