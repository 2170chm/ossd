### Assignments

Due by the end of the week:
- Test out some of the add-on projects created by other teams.
- Look at the live log for the add-on project of a team that you were assigned. Provide an evaluation for it at
  the _Live Log Evaluation_ page on the class wiki (the team assignments will be shared on Slack).
- Make your blog post for the week
  - comment about your group work on the browser extension
  - describe your own contributions to your team's efforts of building
  your browser extension
  - comment on new things you learned (tools, features of tools that you were not familiar with, etc) or
  learned about yourself (skills you realized you have, team work preferences and style, etc.)
  - comment on other teams presentations and their projects

Ongoing (but seems to be neglected by most):
- Make _small_ open source contributions. Refer back to [Contributions you should be working on, slides](slides/contributions.html)
from a couple of weeks ago for the types of contributions and the workflow for the course website contributions (use the same workflow if you wish to contribute to any of the add-on projects).
