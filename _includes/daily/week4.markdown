### Assignments

Due by the end of the week:
- Test out some of the add-on projects created by other teams. Report 
any issues you find. If you are interested in contributing to the project, reach out 
to its community to try to add features, fix issues, etc. 

- Make your blog post for the week
  - comment about your group work on the browser extension, did you learn anything 
  about yourself and how you are able to work with others? 
  - describe your own contributions to your team's efforts of building
  your browser extension
  - comment on new things you learned (tools, features of tools that you were not familiar with, etc) or
  learned about yourself (skills you realized you have, team work preferences and style, etc.)
  - comment on other teams presentations and their projects, did you have any favorites? 

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mekarpeles/">Mek Karpeles</a> from <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>/<a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> will be our first invited speaker this semester.
    - take a look at the websites for the Internet Archive and Open Library
    - add a question for Mek,  to the course wiki
      - add your own question, and enter a number 1 next to it
      - read through existing questions, and up-vote the questions you like
        (replace the number next to them with a number __one higher__
      - go back to the page on Monday, Feb 20 to cast your vote on
        additional questions if you like them

Ongoing (but seems to be neglected by most):
- Make _small_ open source contributions. Refer back to [Contributions you should be working on, slides](slides/contributions.html)
from a couple of weeks ago for the types of contributions and the workflow for the course website contributions (use the same workflow if you wish to contribute to any of the add-on projects).<br/>
A few things to keep in mind:
- make sure links are clickable
- remove the _template_ line from the table of your contributions
- make sure your contributions are diverse, not targetting a single type (ex., only Wikipedia, or only course website)
