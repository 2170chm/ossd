Due as soon as possible (but definitely by the end of Tuesday):
- add a question for  Kevin P. Fleming, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kpfleming/) to the course wiki
  - add your own question, and enter a number 1 next to it
  - read through existing questions, and up-vote the questions you like
    (replace the number next to them with a number __one higher__
  - go back to the page Wednesday morning to cast your vote on
    additional questions if you like them

Due by the end of the week (Feb. 29):
- reflect on your goals for open source contributions, your skills and your interests in the
`taking_stock` repository in the course organization (you should see your own private repository for this)
- make your week 5 blog post
    - reflect on the project evaluations that were completed in class: what did
    you learn? what was challenging and why? do you think you are ready to select a
    project to contribute to?  
    - reflect on the invited talk: what did you learn? what was surprising/unexpected? what was interesting?
    did your view of the interaction of open source projects and large companies change?
    - comment on your contributions (make sure that you are recording them in the contributions page on your blog)
