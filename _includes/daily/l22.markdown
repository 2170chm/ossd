As soon as possible (but needs to be updated regularly):
Create a wiki page for your group project. The page should contain the following information:
- name of the project with links to their official website and their software repositories
- names and github names of the members of your team
- list of all contributions you have made so far (update this list as you make progress)
  - types of contributions: issue reports, comments on existing issues, pull requests
  - for each contribution briefly describe what it was and what you did, indicate who in your group
    was working on it, mention any issues or problems you run into


Due by the end of the week (Apr. 26):
- make your weekly blog post

Ongoing:
- continue working with your group
- continue making your individual contributions
