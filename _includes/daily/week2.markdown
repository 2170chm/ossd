### Lecture 2


<!--


Create your first open source project (at least, in this class).

Find your team members and make sure you are sitting together so that
you can work together.


The instructions for the activity are at [Browser Add-on Activity](https://github.com/joannakl/ossd_materials/blob/master/activities/browser_add-on_activity.md) repository.

You should keep a Slack live-log during this activity.
- Create a channel in the course workspace on Slack.
- Invite all group members to the channel.
- Invite your instructor to the channel.
- Log your progress as you complete different parts of the activity.
(But do not duplicate the answers that you are providing elsewhere.)
There should be regular entries in the log.
You should no be just summarizing what you did at the very end.

See a sample live log's [transcript](https://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/ossd_s20/activities/sample_live_log.html) and make sure you create a similar live log to keep track of your group's progress.
