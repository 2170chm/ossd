### Assignments

Due by the end of the week (i.e., Sunday)
- Clone the repository called [taking stock](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/taking_stock) from the class organization. Use it
to organize your goals and motivations for the open source contributions, your skills and resources that you are bringing
to the table, and your interests that may play a role in your choice of a project and the team that you end you end up working with. This is for your private account and you do not need to submit anything. But you should treat it seriously.
- Pick an open source project that you may be interested in contributing to (this should be something that you are excited about, something that you think you may want to be working on, something that matches your goals and skills as you outlined them in the _taking stock_ exercise; it also should NOT be one of the projects assigned in the first part of the project evaluation exercise that you completed with a partner last week). Complete the project evaluation and create a file for that project in the [project evaluation](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/project-evaluation) repository.
- Complete the [project preference](https://forms.gle/1Kbi5zjg2wKR6vci9) form. The data you provide there will be used to form the project groups for the remainder of the semester.
- Make your blog post:
  - reflect on Chrispher Snider presentation
  - reflect on the role that open efforts play in communities
