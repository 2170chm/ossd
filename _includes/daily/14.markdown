Due by the end of this week (3/31):
- blog about your personal progress towards the team project: what have you done,
what did you learn, what are the tasks that you will be working on next week
- blog about your take on Wikipedia and other projects like that:
    - from your own point of view, what kind of people contribute to Wikipedia
    - do you think you might one day become a regular contributor
    - how will you select the articles to contribute as part of the required
      contributions for this class?
    - watch and comment on the TED talk that Jimmy Wales gave on the [_Birth of Wikipedia_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAgpogTplzo) in 2005 (did you find any ideas and topics that were out of date?)
- update the contributions page on your blog (do not include your team contributions there, but
make sure that all of your own contributions are there)

Due in the next couple of weeks:
- make contributions to 2-3 articles on Wikipedia (they can be simple typographical or linking fixes or larger edits) - make
sure that you create an account and make those contributions using your account, since we will need to
verify the edits (put the links to your contributing page on your blog under contributions)
