### Lecture 1

Project group work: meet your group members and decide on the 
project. 

Use the templace on the course wiki to create a _page_ for your project. Call it _Group_XX_project_ to start (where XX is your group number assigned for today). Later, replace the word _project_ with your chosen project name. 

### Lecture 2

Quick report-outs from each group. 
- what project are you working on (if undecided which ones are you considering and 
when are you going to pick)
- what did you accomplish on Monday and since Monday 

A bit of open source [history](slides/history.html)
