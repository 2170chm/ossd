### Assignments

Due by the end of the week:
- One person from each team working on Firefox add-ons should make a post in the
  browser-extension-presentations page on the class wiki.
  The post should follow this format: <br\>
  `Team TeamNumber, [Extension Name](link to the GitHub repo) ` <br\>
  (Where the `Team TeamNumber` is the team number you were given during the in-class session, or
  `Breakout Room 1`, or `Breakout Room 2`, `Team A` - if you were absent and you are in the group working outside of the class
  on the entire project.)
- Make your blog post for the week. Comment on the `git` exercises we did in class and on
  the discussion with Jim Hall.

Due by February 15

  - make sure that the project follows all the best practices of open source
  - prepare a 5 minute presentation about your project (to be delivered in front of the class on Feb 15) - make sure
    that it is a group presentation
