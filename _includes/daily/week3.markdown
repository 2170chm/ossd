### Assignments

Due by the end of the week:
- One person from each team working on Firefox add-ons should make a post in the
  browser-extension-presentations page on the class wiki.
  The post should follow this format: <br/>
  `Team TeamNumber, [Extension Name](link to the GitHub repo) ` <br/>
  (Where the `Team TeamNumber` is the team number you were given during the in-class session.)
- Make your blog post for the week. Comment on the `git` exercises we did in class. Comment on 
the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first browser extension (what 
are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit 
into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions) 

Due by February 12
- with your group, continue working on the add-on project (make sure you keep your live log updated when you meet with your team to work on this project)
- make sure that the project follows all the best practices of open source
- prepare a 5 minute presentation about your project (to be delivered in front of the class on Feb 13) - make sure
    that it is a group presentation

Ongoing
- continue making small personal contributions (keep in mind that they should 
be done on a regular basis and be diverse in terms of their type) 
- start looking at different open source projects from the angle of possible 
contributions
