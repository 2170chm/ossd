Team assessment and plan:
- Based on the team, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the team in terms of
being able to participate in the project you selected? (Use your teammates' blog posts to assess
their strengths and weaknesses)
- Come up with a common meeting time (2 hours block outside of class) to which all
team members can commit. Come up with an alternative meeting time (2 hours block outside of  
class) to which all team members can commit - the second time slot will serve as an alternative for
weeks during which the first time slot does not work and as a second meeting time during weeks
when you need to be able to spend more time working together.
- Create a list of milestones that you need to achieve in order to be able to successfully
contribute to the project you selected.

Setup team repositories:
- create a team repository with the fork of the project that your team selected
- create another team repository that will be used for coordinating work on
the project (use the project board to set up your milestones)
