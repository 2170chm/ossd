Version control systems

Slides:

- [Version control systems ](slides/version_control_systems.html)  
- [GitHub/git workflow](slides/git_workflow_activity.pptx)


Resources:
- hands on practice with self-tests to make sure you are doing the right things: `gitruler` is a tool for self-grading of some basic git activities <br>
if you are new to `git` follow the [Learn git through Problem Based Learning](https://github.com/UOL-CS/gitruler-exercises) exercises  

- for resolving some potential future issues with `git` and GitHub, you might
want to keep [git-flight-rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) on hand <br>
this project is open for contributions as well

- __[Katocoda: Git Version Control](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)__ -
explore different scenarios that may arise and learn how to resolve them.
(Note: I have not tried  these yet, but they come highly recommended.)

- some tutorials, cheat sheets and visualizations of how git works: [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/)
