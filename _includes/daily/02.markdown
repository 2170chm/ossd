Due by the end of the week (2/3):

- if you did not complete the in-class activity, work with your team members to finish
it (up to and including Part 5)

Due by the end of the following week (2/10):

- read the _Getting Started_ section of the MDN [Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)

- __with your team members__ work on the code of your proposed browser extension
(make sure that this is a team work with all team members making contributions -
keep in mind that individual commits made to the repository are tagged with your
username so it is easy for us to identify who is working on what and when) <br>
Note: you may need to revise your original vision of what this extension will do.
