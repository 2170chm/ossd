Due by the end of this week (3/10):

- read Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software by Chamindra de Silva

- blog about your take on using open source software in projects for social good and with humanitarian goals in mind (do you think such projects are easier or harder to get involved with, do you think involvement in such projects bring more or less _prestige_ to the contributor (compared to other projects), would you want to be involved in a project like that?)

- pick one of the humanitarian/social good projects that were mentioned in the slides, the articles linked, or anywhere else that you look for projects AND perform the project evaluation (following the same template as you did for previous projects)

- add a question for Patrick Masson from [OSI](https://opensource.org/), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-masson-4a09b53/), to the course wiki
  - add your own question, and enter a number 1 next to it
  - read through existing questions, and up-vote the questions you like
    (replace the number next to them with a number __one__ higher
  - go back to the page towards the end of the week to cast your vote on
    additional questions if you like them

- decide what project you want to work on (propose a new project on Piazza or join one of the proposed projects)
