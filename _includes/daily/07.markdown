Due by the end of this week (2/24):

- add a question for Christos Bacharakis, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christosbaharakis/?originalSubdomain=gr), to the course wiki
  - add your own question, and enter a number 1 next to it
  - read through existing questions, and up-vote the questions you like
    (replace the number next to them with a number __one__ higher
  - go back to the page towards the end of the week to cast your vote on
    additional questions if you like them

- pick an open source project (something that you might be interested in contributing to)
  and perform a project evaluation on it (following the steps and questions similar to the ones
  in class)

- blog about
  - introduce the project that you selected to evaluate (your own, not the one you worked on in class)
    and explain why you picked it (why is it interesting to you)
  - post your project evaluation (make sure that it is easy to follow by others who may be
    interested in the same project)
  - add an entry to the course wiki listing the project name, a link to the project website, a link
    to the project repository and a link to your evaluation page (your blog post)
