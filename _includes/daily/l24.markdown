__Group stand-up reports__ (~5 minutes each - and we have to keep to the time)
- provide update on your interactions with the community
- provide update on contributions you made
- what you hope/expect to accomplish in the next 1-2 weeks
- list the presentation dates in order of preference
(You should, if possible, have your camera on so we can see the people who are talking.
Make sure that the talking is distributed between group members and that it is organized - you should
not be interrupting one another. Do not use slides or share screen for this one - save it for the actual
presentations.)
