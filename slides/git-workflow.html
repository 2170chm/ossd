- On your local machine clone the following repository
  `https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/demo`
  from the course organization.

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/demo
  ```



The repository is a skeleton with which we will be working. It contains
two branches, one named `master` and one named  `feature1`.

For the rest of these instructions, we will assume that the name
of the repository that you created is `demo`.

---

- In your browser navigate to the course organization and create
a brand new empty repository called  `<your-github-name>-git-exercise`.

  Make it public and do not initialize it with any files.

  (__DO NOT click _Create repository_ just yet.__)

- On the page that is then displayed, choose the option

  `...or push an existing repository from the command line`

  and copy the command-line instructions for that option to your clipboard.

- Execute these instructions from within your local repository `demo`.

  - This will overwrite the previous `origin` remote.

      Verify this by executing
      ```bash
      git remote -v
      ```
      (the `origin` should now point to the remote repository that includes
      your GitHub name)

  - This also pushes the `master` branch to the remote repository.

---

## `git` visualization tools

There are many tools that allow you to visualize the branch structure
of a `git` repository.  Some examples are,

  - gitg

  - qgit

  - gitk

We can also do it on GitHub (when the branches that we are visualizing are
there) using the _Insights_ tab and selecting _Network_ on the right.

Finally, we can do it in a console using just `git` by running

```bash
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

--

Use one of these options to view the branches in your local `demo` repository.


---

__Let's make our remote repository on GitHub a bit more interesting__

- We will create a few commits on GitHub so that
your local  `master` branch will be __behind the `origin/master`
remote branch__.

  To do this, you will create two files on GitHub, put
  some text into them and commit them. Name these files

  - `gh_file1`
  - `gh_file2`

  Their content can be whatever you want. You can also use the default commit message.

---

- Now you will create a new feature branch on GitHub, __not on your
local machine__.

  To do this,
  - locate the button on the left-hand side of the screen that displays
  the text "branch: master".
  - click that button once and a pop-up window will be displayed that has an empty text
  box with the text "`find or create a branch`" as well as a list of your repository's existing branches below it.
  - in that text box, type  `feature2`
  - anothed small pop-up window will be displayed
  with the text "`Create branch: feature2 from master`"
  - click the box


--

- Make sure that you are on `feature2` branch on GitHub and create two new files in it

  - `feature2_file1`
  - `feature2_file2`


You now have a feature branch on GitHub that is __ahead of the `master` branch__ on
GitHub by two commits.

- Use the _Insights_ tab and _Network_ to see the structure of branches on GitHub.
(Note that your local branch `feature1` is not there.)

---
__Optional__

- Create yet another branch on GitHub called `exploratory`

- Create two files called

  - `option1`
  - `option2`



  - Use the _Insights_ tab and _Network_ to see the structure of branches on GitHub.

---

We will now simulate what happens when you and your team members have
been working independently. Although you just created a bunch of files yourself
on GitHub, this could have also been the result of your team members pushing
their own changes up to the common repository. That is how you should think
of it for now: the files and commits you made on GitHub are really the work
of others that took place concurrently with what you are about to do.

---

- Create a few more files in the `feature1` branch in your
repository. This simulates your working on your own on the feature branch.

  - Check out the `feature1` branch in your repository:
    ```bash
      git checkout feature1
    ```

  - If you are running `bash`, you can use the following `bash` `for` loop to create,
    add to the repository and commit new files

    ```bash
      $ for i in 3 4 5 ; do
           echo "feature1_${i}" > feature1_${i}
           git add feature1_${i}
           git commit . -m "added feature1_${i}"
        done
    ```

    Alternatively, you can do this manually:
    - create a file called `feature1_3`
    - add it to the staging area: `git add feature1_3`
    - commit the change: `git commit -m added feature1_3`
    and the same for `feature1_4` and `feature1_5` files





Your `feature1` branch is now several commits ahead of the master.


---

- Visualize the current state of your local repository.

---

You want to  pull down the work that has been done from the upstream, but
you __will not__ use the `git pull` command to do this. You will use `git fetch`.


- Fetch upstream `master` branch for now, the one that is _tracked_
by your local `master` branch, and the one that is known locally as
`origin/master`. Enter the following two commands. You will see messages from
Git that we will ignore for now.

  ```bash
    git checkout master
    git fetch origin master
  ```


- Look at the content of the current working directory - it did not change (i.e.,
the new files from the `master` branch on GitHub have not yet been incorporated)

- Visualize the current state of your local repository again. You should be able to
see the information about the commits make in the remote branch.



__Fetching brings down the data from the upstream but it does not modify your
working directory. This is often safer than just pulling which does not give you
a chance to verify the commits that have been applied to the branches__.

---

- We will do a __fast-forward__ merge to move the `master` branch up to date
with `origin/master`. This is done by executing

    ```bash
    git merge origin/master
    ```

- Look at your working directory again and see that the files are
there! The `merge` updates the working directory.

---

Now it is time to integrate the work on the `feature1` branch with
the upstream changes from the `master` branch. But we will not use `merge`.
This is a perfect chance to practice rebasing.

- Visualize the current state of your local repository.

- To rebase (i.e., apply the changes in feature1 on top of the current master)
  - first checkout the `feature1` branch
      ```bash
      git checkout feature1
      ```
  - and then exete
      ```bash
      git rebase master
      ```

- Visualize the current state of your local repository again.

The history that you see now is linear; your `feature1` branch is
just a chain,  a few commits ahead of the `master` (and `origin/master`)
branch.

---

Suppose now that the team member who was responsible for developing
`feature2` contacts everyone and says that the version of `feature2` on the
server is final and can be merged into the `master` branch. She asks you if you
can do her the favor, since you already have the most recent `master` on your
local machine, of fetching the `feature2` branch and integrating it into your
local copy, after which it can be pushed back up to the upstream. You agree
to do this.

---

To do so, you will need to

- Fetch that upstream `feature2` branch and merge it in.
We will use the `fetch/merge` approach to do this. We fetch the `feature2` branch:

  ```bash
    $ git fetch origin feature2
  ```

- Visualize the current state of your local repository to see the branch `origin/feature2`
listed there now.

  The `feature2` branch tip is two commits ahead of `master`.

- Create a local branch that is tracking the changes in the remote `origin/feature2` branch:

  ```bash
   git checkout -b feature2 origin/feature2
  ```

Because `master` is an ancestor of `feature2` and not on a different part
of the tree, we can do a __fast-forward merge__ to __integrate the feature into the
master branch__.

- switch to the `master` branch to do a fast-forward merge:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git merge feature2
    ```

- Visualize the current state of your local repository to see the most recent changes.

---


Notice that  `feature1` is no longer ahead of `master`; they are not on the same linear path.
  In other words, `feature1` no longer is based on the most recent version of the `master`
  branch.


Our last task should be to fix this. We will __rebase__ our `feature1` branch
on `master` again.

What are the instructions that will do this?

--

```bash
git checkout feature1
git rebase master
```


---

__Optional__

If you created the optional `exploratory` branch on GitHub, you fetch it for the
purpose of seeing what is happening on that branch (for example, to see what you team
makes are working on).

```bash
git fetch origin exploratory
```

You can look at the files in that remote branch without creating a local branch dedicated
to it.

```bash
$ git checkout origin/exploratory
Note: checking out 'origin/exploratory'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at ec96968 Create option2
```

---



By doing this we can examine the files, which _are_ in our working directory.
If we want to do any work and be able to make commits, we need to follow Git's
advice and create a new tracking branch.

But if you were just looking and now you are ready to go back to your
existing local branches, you can simply execute

```bash
git checkout master
```

to return to the _attached_ HEAD state.
