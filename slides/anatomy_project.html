__Non-core contributors__

- make regular contributions
- active in isse dicussions
- provide feedback to the newer members of the community

## Tools: Issue Tracking

issue tracking = bug tracking = ticketing system

- _place_ where the project tracks issues related to the project

- what are _issues_?
  - feature requests
  - feature suggestions
  - bugs / problems discovered with the code
  - improvement suggestions
  - support questions
  - design decisions
  - team discussions

- how should _you_ use the issue tracker?
  - first study existing issues (both open and closed), to learn how the
    community uses the issue tracker
  - if there is documentation about how to use the issue tracker, study it
  - follow what you learned above in your own use of the issue tracker for that project

---

## Tools: Other

- other tools depend on the project itself

- you need to make sure that you are familiar with (or are willing to
  learn / have time to learn) the tools that the project useses
