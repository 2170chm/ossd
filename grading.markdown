# Grading Components

## Preparedness / Attendance / Engagement  (PAE) 10%

The success of the this class is in a large part up to you as its primary participants. My hope is that you will all engage in the material, prepare carefully and come to our meetings excited to participate in discussions and activities with your peers. If that happens then our meetings will be lively and interesting and we will be able to focus largely on the aspects of the material that are most interesting to you as a group. Plus, its good practice - many employers are now using [Group Discussions as a screening technique before or during interviews](https://www.reed.co.uk/career-advice/group-interview-tips-dos-and-donts/)!

PAE is assessed for each student during each class period. Preparation includes completion of any reading, tutorials, exercises or activities assigned (based on the ability to participate in class discussion, answering questions, posing questions and posting comments before class). Attendance is your presence in class during our scheduled meetings. Engagement combines participation in discussion and activities with a demonstrated investment both in the material and the betterment of the class for everyone.

PAE scores will be assigned according to the rubric below. The standard score in each category, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or ✓++,  or down to 0 or ✓-.  


|Score | Preparation |  Attendance| Engagement |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
|0|Failed to demonstrate any familiarity with the assigned materials. | Did not attend the class or was not present for significant portions of class period. | Consistently inactive, distracted , disconnected and showing none or little interest in class discussion and activities.|
|✓-| Demonstrated only minimal familiarity and interest in the assigned materials.  | Attended class but may have been late and/or left the room with usual frequency or duration |Frequent periods of distraction, inattention or disinterest.   |
|✓ | Demonstrated __expected__ familiarity with assigned materials. | Attended class, was on time and present in the class throughout period.|Engaged in discussion and activities.  |
|✓+| Demonstrated __strong__ familiarity with the assigned materials. Took part in the class discussion by sharing the insights and personal reflections.| Unused | Engaged in discussions and activities in an exceptional way that enhanced it for everyone. |
|✓++|Demonstrated __exceptional__ familiarity with the assigned materials. Took initiative in finding and sharing related content. Approached the materials in unique and creative ways. | Unused. | Unused. |


## Blogs / Reflective Writing  20%

An important part of learning about and understanding issues is to reflect upon them after reading and discussion. This gives you a chance to process the information, organize your thoughts, incorporate insights from others. To facilitate this reflection, each week  you are asked to write a blog post reflecting/expanding on some aspect of the reading/discussion topic that was of interest to you, comment and reflect on an invited talk, or answer to the prompts posted for that week on the course website. Doing this on a public blog encourages careful thought, precise writing and can provide evidence of your knowledge and abilities to prospective employers and/or graduate programs.

Posts will typically be 200-600 words. You are given wide latitude for the content of your posts. The best posts will:

- be closely related to the reading/discussion
- be clear, focused and grammatically correct
- be written to be of interest to an audience beyond our course
- go beyond a mere summary of the reading/discussion
- include multimedia (images, audio, video, etc.) only as appropriate to enhance the content of the post. Be sure that if you use any external content that you are using it in a way that is allowed by its license.

The blog posts will be assessed throughout the semester using the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or ✓++,  or down to 0 or ✓-.  

|Score | Timeliness |  Mechanics and Formatting| Writing and Content |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
|0| Post missing or late more than three days. | Post is of trivial length. | Writing is largely incoherent or content shows no connection with the readings/discussions or prompts for the given week. |
|✓-| Post made late, but within three days of the due date.  | Writing is very brief, formatting is lacking making the post hard to read.  | Writing is only loosely  connected to the readings/discussions and prompts for the given week. Post enumerates answers  and ideas rather than containing organized narrative. |
|✓ | Post made by the due date.  | Post is of appropriate length, is formatted properly, is easy to follow, and multimedia use (if any) is appropriate.  | Writing is clear, concise, interesting on topic, clearly connected to the readings/discussions or prompts for the given week.  |
|✓+| Unused. | Unused | Additionally, post is exceptionally well organized or interesting.  |
|✓++| Unused. | Unused. | Additionally, post shows personal insights, carefully thought out reflections and  creativity.  |

## Activities / Exercises / Homework 10%

Early in the semester there will be a number of in-class activities, tutorials and homework assignments designed to introduce you to some of the tools and techniques commonly used in FOSS projects (and in professional software development as well). Typically these assignments will require you to complete some tutorials and activities while keeping a Slack Live-Log (see below) of your work. .

Tutorials and homework exercises will be assessed largely on completion and effort as documented by the associated Slack live-logs according to the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or ✓++,  or down to 0 or ✓-.  

|Score | Activity |
|:---:|:---|
|0| Live-log entries are minimal or absent and/or provide little to no evidence of the progress and completion of the assigned work. OR live-log entries are inappropriate. |
|✓-| Live-log entries are vague, infrequent, or fail to sufficiently demonstrate an appropriate level of thoughtful engagement with the assignment.  |
|✓ |  Live-log entries are sufficiently detailed, regular, clearly demonstrating the sufficient effort was made to thoughtfully engage with and understand the assignment. |
|✓+| Live-logs meet criteria for ✓ __and__ demonstrate that students expanded on the assigned work in interesting, productive and/or creative ways. |
|✓++| Unused. |



## Individual Contributions to FOSS projects: 20%

Throughout the semester students are expected to make regular _individual_ contributions (the contributions to one's selected group project are not included in the individual contributions unless they were made prior to group formation and selection of the project). The nature of these contributions will change in the course of the semester, but they should be done regularly (not in bursts) throughout the first 10 weeks of the semester. (At the end of the semester, students should concentrate on
their group projects and the level of individual contributions will naturally decrease.)

The examples of individual contributions are shown below. This is __not__ and exclusive list and most individual contributions to _open_ projects (not necessarily source code)
will be counted towards the grade.
- Wikipedia edits
- OpenStreetMap edits
- Comments on existing issues, reporting of new issues and submitting fixes for other student blog repositories
- Comments on existing issues, reporting of new issues and submitting fixes for the course website
- Comments on issues of FOSS projects
- Reporting issues for FOSS projects
- Contributing fixes for existing issues in FOSS projects

The individual contributions should be documented on the _Contribution_ page of your individual blogs. They will be assessed three times during the course of the semester using the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or ✓++,  or down to 0 or ✓-.  


|Score | Frequency / Regularity | Content |
|:---:|:---|:---|
|0| Very few contributions  or all contributions made in one burst. | All contributions are trivial.  |
|✓- | Few contributions but made regularly throughout the evaluated period OR satisfactory number of contributions but made in bursts.   | Many contributions are trivial with a few providing meaningful benefit to the project. |
|✓ |  Satisfactory number of contributions that are made regularly throughout the evaluated period.  | Contributions clearly benefit the project and communities around that project. |
|✓+|  Contributions meet criteria for ✓  and there is unusually large number of significant contributions.  | Contributions meet criteria for ✓ and some of the contributions are significant in terms of challenge that they posed during the issue resolution or benefit that they provide to the community. |
|✓++| Unused. | Contributions meet criteria for ✓+  and have been received with exceptional enthusiasm by the community of the project. |

## Group Project (individual's contributions to the group  project): 30%

In the second half of the semester, students will be working in groups of 3-4 students on contributions to a selected project. Each student's contributions to this group effort will be assessed individually based on several checkpoints:
- project selection and the initial presentation
- weekly five-fifteens (see below)
- Slack live-logs
- interaction with the community
- contributions made to the project
- final presentation

The group contributions should be documented on the wiki page for the group project.

The six aspects of the group project will be assessed according to the rubric for each item below.
The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or ✓++,  or down to 0 or ✓-.  

### Project selection and the initial presentation

### Weekly five-fifteens

### Slack live-logs
