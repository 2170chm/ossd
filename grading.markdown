## Preparedness / Attendance / Engagement  (PAE) 10%

The success of the this class is in a large part up to you as its primary participants. My hope is that you will all engage in the material, prepare carefully and come to our meetings excited to participate in discussions and activities with your peers. If that happens then our meetings will be lively and interesting and we will be able to focus largely on the aspects of the material that are most interesting to you as a group. Plus, its good practice - many employers are now using [Group Discussions as a screening technique before or during interviews](https://www.reed.co.uk/career-advice/group-interview-tips-dos-and-donts/)!

PAE is assessed for each student during each class period. Preparation includes completion of any reading, tutorials, exercises or activities assigned (based on the ability to participate in class discussion, answering questions, posing questions and posting comments before class). Attendance is your presence in class during our scheduled meetings. Engagement combines participation in discussion and activities with a demonstrated investment both in the material and the betterment of the class for everyone.

PAE scores will be assigned according to the rubric below. The standard score in each category, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or ✓++,  or down to 0 or ✓-.

## Blogs / Reflective Writing  20%

An important part of learning about and understanding issues is to reflect upon them after reading and discussion. This gives you a chance to process the information, organize your thoughts, incorporate insights from others. To facilitate this reflection, each week  you are asked to write a blog post reflecting/expanding on some aspect of the reading/discussion topic that was of interest to you, comment and reflect on an invited talk, or answer to the prompts posted for that week on the course website. Doing this on a public blog encourages careful thought, precise writing and can provide evidence of your knowledge and abilities to prospective employers and/or graduate programs.

Posts will typically be 200-600 words. You are given wide latitude for the content of your posts. The best posts will:

- be closely related to the reading/discussion
- be clear, focused and grammatically correct
- be written to be of interest to an audience beyond our course
- go beyond a mere summary of the reading/discussion
- include multimedia (images, audio, video, etc.) only as appropriate to enhance the content of the post. Be sure that if you use any external content that you are using it in a way that is allowed by its license.

The blog posts will be assessed throughout the semester using the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or ✓++,  or down to 0 or ✓-.  

|Score | Timeliness |  Mechanics and Formatting| Writing and Content |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|0| Post missing or trivial. | Post is of trivial length. | Writing is largely incoherent or content shows no connection with the readings/discussions or prompts for the given week. |
|✓-| Post made late, but within three days of the due date.  | Writing is very brief, formatting is lacking making the post hard to read.  | Writing is only loosely  connected to the readings/discussions and prompts for the given week. Post enumerates answers  and ideas rather than containing organized narrative. |
|✓ | Post made by the due date.  | Post is of appropriate length, is formatted properly, is easy to follow, and multimedia use (if any) is appropriate.  | Writing is clear, concise, interesting on topic, clearly connected to the readings/discussions or prompts for the given week.  |
|✓+| Unused. | Unused | Additionally, post is exceptionally well organized or interesting.  |
|✓++| Unused. | Unused. | Additionally, post shows personal insights, carefully thought out reflections and  creativity.  |
