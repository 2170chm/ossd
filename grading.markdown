## Preparedness / Attendance / Engagement  (PAE) 10%

The success of the this class is in a large part up to you as its primary participants. My hope is that you will all engage in the material, prepare carefully and come to our meetings excited to participate in discussions and activities with your peers. If that happens then our meetings will be lively and interesting and we will be able to focus largely on the aspects of the material that are most interesting to you as a group. Plus, its good practice - many employers are now using [Group Discussions as a screening technique before or during interviews](https://www.reed.co.uk/career-advice/group-interview-tips-dos-and-donts/)!

PAE is assessed for each student during each class period. Preparation includes completion of any reading, tutorials, exercises or activities assigned (based on the ability to participate in class discussion, answering questions, posing questions and posting comments before class). Attendance is your presence in class during our scheduled meetings. Engagement combines participation in discussion and activities with a demonstrated investment both in the material and the betterment of the class for everyone.

PAE scores will be assigned according to the rubric below. The standard score in each category, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-.
